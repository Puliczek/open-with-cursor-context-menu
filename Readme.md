# 🖱️ Open with Cursor in Context Menu

This project provides PowerShell scripts to add and remove "Open with Cursor" options to the Windows context menu for files, folders, and background areas.

![Open with Cursor Context Menu](image.png)


## ✨ Features

- Adds "Open with Cursor" option to:
  - File context menu 📄
  - Folder context menu 📁
  - Background context menu (when right-clicking in an empty area of a folder) 🖼️
- Removes these context menu entries with uninstalling script 🗑️


## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the `install-open-with-cursor.ps1` script from https://github.com/Puliczek/open-with-cursor-context-menu/raw/main/install-open-with-cursor.ps1
2. Right-click on the downloaded script and select "Run with PowerShell".
3. If prompted, allow the script to run with administrator privileges.

The script will automatically add the "Open with Cursor" options to your context menus. ✅

## 🔧 Troubleshooting 

If you see following tips: can not load ...., seee about_Execution_Policies

You need to run command like 

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

It will allow you run ps1 scripts from github, after done, please run following command to reset it

```bash

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope CurrentUser
```

If the context menu options don't appear immediately after running the installation script:

Restart Windows Explorer using Terminal:

   - Press Win + X and select "Terminal (Admin)"
   - Run the following command:
     ```powershell
     Stop-Process -Name explorer -Force; Start-Process explorer
     ```

   This command will close and restart Windows Explorer, which should refresh your context menu without requiring a full system restart. 🔄🖱️

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

1. Download the `uninstall-open-with-cursor.ps1` script from https://github.com/Puliczek/open-with-cursor-context-menu/raw/main/uninstall-open-with-cursor.ps1
2. Right-click on the downloaded script and select "Run with PowerShell".
3. If prompted, allow the script to run with administrator privileges.

The script will remove all "Open with Cursor" entries from your context menus. ❌

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Installation Script 📥

The `install-open-with-cursor.ps1` script:

1. Checks for administrator privileges and re-launches with elevated rights if necessary.
2. Locates the Cursor executable in the default installation directory.
3. Adds registry entries for the context menu options.

### Uninstallation Script 🗑️

The `uninstall-open-with-cursor.ps1` script:

1. Checks for administrator privileges and re-launches with elevated rights if necessary.
2. Removes the registry entries added by the installation script.

## 📝 Notes

- Both scripts require administrator privileges to modify the registry.
- The installation script assumes Cursor is installed in its default location. If you've installed Cursor in a different location, you may need to modify the script.
